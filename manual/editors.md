# Lyph editor

The "Lyph editor" tab provides a GUI for lyph editing. The view consists of 3 hierarchical 
trees and property display panel where modellers can see and edit properties of the selected lyph.

The first tree view shows the list of declared lyphs arranged into hierarchy by the 
`sypertype`/`subtypes` relationships. By clicking on the lyph identifier in this component, one selects 
a lyph to inspect and modify. 

The second view shows the layers of the selected lyph.
